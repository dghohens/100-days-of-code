# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Setup prior to challenge
**I did the following before starting this challenge:**
- I had taken some introductory courses on C and Fortran in college, and I have played around with bash scripting, TI-83+ BASIC, HTML, and Javascript.
- Completed the Python 2.7 tutorial on Codecademy
    - [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com/)
- Completed Project Euler problems 1-50 using basic Python scripts
    - [Project Euler] (https://projecteuler.net/)
- Read about half of "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python"
    - [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python] (https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
- Wrote some basic Python scripts for work
- Installed PyCharm on my PC
    - [PyCharm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
- Set up my GitHub account
    - [GitHub] (https://github.com/)
- Integrated PyCharm with GitHub
    - This required that I first install Git to my local PC
        - [Git] (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
    - I then had to set up PyCharm for Git integration
        - [Using Git integration with PyCharm] (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html)
    - Then I had to integrate PyCharm with GitHub

### Day 1: Thursday November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through Warmup-1 > sleep_in on CodingBat, and completed Challenge 1 from PyBites

**Thoughts** I didn't make much progress today, and I felt that every single step was a struggle. I'm looking forward to getting better at this!

### Day 2: Friday, November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Challenge 2 from PyBites, it's still a work in progress.

**Thoughts** I feel like I made even less progress than yesterday, but I feel like I spent less time looking at documentation and more time trying to figure out the logic of my program. I'm not sure if this is good, but it feels like I'm making progress. I also feel like I was thinking about Python pretty much all day yesterday, and I was excited to start coding this morning, so that's good!

### Day 3: Saturday, November 3rd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Challenge 2 from PyBites, it's still a work in progress. This challenge runs now, but it doesn't give me the expected output and I'm still debugging a couple functions in the program. I learned about using os.chdir() and sys.path.append() in IDLE to debug problem functions that reference local file paths, which was pretty helpful for this particular challenge.

**Thoughts** I probably spent about half an hour writing code today, and about 2 hours debugging what I had written. It's been very slow progress, but I was finding issues at a rate of about one every 20 minutes. I feel like I'm at the point today where staring at code isn't going to help anymore, and I need to look at this more tomorrow. Overall, it's been a mix of enjoyment and frustration.
