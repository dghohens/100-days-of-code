# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Setup prior to challenge


### Day 1: Thursday November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through Warmup-1 > sleep_in on CodingBat, and completed Challenge 1 from PyBites

**Thoughts** I didn't make much progress today, and I felt that every single step was a struggle. I'm looking forward to getting better at this!
