# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Setup prior to challenge


### Day 1: Thursday November 1st, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went through Warmup-1 > sleep_in on CodingBat, and completed Challenge 1 from PyBites

**Thoughts** I didn't make much progress today, and I felt that every single step was a struggle. I'm looking forward to getting better at this!

### Day 2: Friday, November 2nd, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I worked on Challenge 2 from PyBites, it's still a work in progress.

**Thoughts** I feel like I made even less progress than yesterday, but I feel like I spent less time looking at documentation and more time trying to figure out the logic of my program. I'm not sure if this is good, but it feels like I'm making progress. I also feel like I was thinking about Python pretty much all day yesterday, and I was excited to start coding this morning, so that's good!
